- What are your initial impressions of Java? 

In comparison to python, Java is more picky. There are more things that you have to do with java while python is more straightforward. Not many things from python translate to Java, I had to do a lot of research.

- Can you draw any conclusion about programming in general from the similarities or the differences between the two languages? 

Switching languages requires a lot of research especially when you weren't able to gain much experience in the previous language. Not everything translates from the languages you learn. Somethings are similar but not everything.

- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

Start the assignment the day it is given, go to TA hours and find a group to work with. What didn't work was referring to older assignments because I just got more confused.The same can be said for the notes since most of them were in Python. Practice writing Psuedocode. I would tell the person to take a supplemental course on Java for beginners before taking the course.
