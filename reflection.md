- What are your initial impressions of Java? 

In comparison to python, Java is more picky. There are more things that you have to do with java while python I feel is more straightforward. Many things from python translate to Java but  I had to do a lot of research.

- Can you draw any conclusion about programming in general from the similarities or the differences between the two languages? 

Switching languages requires a lot of research and can be confusing at moments . Not everything translates from the languages you learn. Somethings are very similar. Python requires less mandatory syntax while Java just requires a bit more syntax like specifing the type of varibale or parameter.

- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

Start the assignment the day it is given, go to TA hours and find a group to work with. What didn't work was referring to older assignments because I just got more confused.The same can be said for the notes since most of them were in Python. Practice writing Psuedocode. Ask everyone for advice because it helps to talk out your code, it will usually allow you to catch your bugs.
